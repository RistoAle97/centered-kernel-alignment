## :black_nib: About
> [!NOTE]
> Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) [1] is a similarity index between representations of features in neural networks, based on the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) [2]. Given a set of examples, CKA compares the representations of examples passed through the layers that we want to compare.

Given two matrices $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times s_1}$ and $Y \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times s_2}$ representing the output of two layers, we can define two auxiliary $n \times n$ Gram matrices $K=XX^T$ and $L=YY^T$ and compute the *dot-product similarity* between them
$$\langle vec(XX^T), vec(YY^T)\rangle = tr(XX^T YY^T) = \lVert Y^T X \rVert_F^2.$$
Then, the HSIC on $K$ and $L$ is defined as
$$HSIC(K, L) = \frac{tr(KHLH)}{(n - 1)^2},$$
where $H = I_n - \frac{1}{n}J_n$ is the centering matrix and $J_n$ is an $n \times n$ matrix filled with ones. Finally, to obtain the CKA value we only need to normalize HSIC
$$CKA(K, L) = \frac{HSIC(K, L)}{\sqrt{HSIC(K, K) HSIC(L, L)}}.$$
